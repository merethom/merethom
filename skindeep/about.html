<h5 style="line-height:40px">What is Skin Deep?</h5>
<h8>There is ongoing debate and study about the safety of ingredients commonly found in cosmetics. Skin Deep allows you to easily find the Environmental Working Group's safety rating and ingredient information for any of Sephora's products. When you search for a product, you will find information about its hazard rating, data gap, ingredients, and known health issues complied from more than 50 government and industry sources on ingredient toxicity. Using Skin Deep will enable you to make informed decisions about the cosmetics you choose to use and buy.</h8>
<br /><br />
<h5 style="line-height:40px">What is the hazard score?</h5>
<h8> The hazard score is shown on a scale from 1 to 10 (with no decimals, and 10 corresponding to the highest level of concern). The hazard score represents a synthesis of known and suspected hazards from more than 50 definitive databases. The hazard rating of a product can be higher than for its individual ingredients — it adds up the hazards of all ingredients, and is scaled higher if the product has penetration enhancers or other ingredients that increase skin absorption. The hazard score calculation does not account for data gaps. The two scores are separately calculated. So now you can see both what is known about the safety of an ingredient, and how complete the available science is behind that safety score. More details on the scoring procedure can be <a href="http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/about.php#3">found here.</a> </h8>
<br /><br />
<h5 style="line-height:40px">What is a data gap?</h5>
<h8>The data gap rating is a measure of how much is unknown about an ingredient. Not all ingredients have the same amount of safety data. For example, some ingredients may appear to have low hazards, but this may be due to the fact that they have not have been studied or assessed completely. Other ingredients may appear to have low hazards and have been thoroughly studied or assessed. This score helps differentiate between ingredients and products that have been studied to different degrees.</h8>
<br /><br />
<h5 style="line-height:40px">Are ingredients in cosmetics actually harmful?</h5>
<h8>While some companies make products that are safe to eat, other companies choose to use known human carcinogens or developmental toxins. Nearly all these chemicals can penetrate the skin, and some we ingest directly from our lips or hands. More than one-third of all personal care products contain at least one ingredient linked to cancer. When risky and unstudied chemicals are used in cosmetics, the stakes can be high—unlike trace contaminants in food or tap water— chemicals in cosmetics are base ingredients.</h8>
