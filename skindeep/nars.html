<b>Directions from packaging:</b> Once the lips have been defined with appropriate lip liner, use the Lip Brush to apply lipstick to the lip. Using the Lip Brush will provide control and aid in blending. Applying the lipstick directly from the tube will allow a richer application of color. For more of a matte finish and to remove excess product, place tissue over the lips and gently smooth finger over the lips. Application Tip:For Extra Long Lasting Color:Define and fill in entire lip with lip liner. Apply lip color directly from tube. Using only a single ply of tissue place tissue over the lips. Using a powder puff or sponge, pat loose powder over the lips to set. Reapply lipstick. Full Looking Lips:Add Lip Gloss or Lip Lacquer just in the center of the bottom lip and at the bow of the top lip.
